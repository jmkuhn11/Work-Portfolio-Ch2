# Work-Portfolio-Ch2

##Description

I was asked by an employer to create a portfolio to look at my work experience and evaluate my coding capabilities. They wanted to look at past projects I developed to see if I was a quality candidate for the position. Througn my first week of coding, I understood how to create a document and use basic CSS to color and decorate it. However, this portfolio gave me the chance to test my capabilities by making a website from scratch. Through making this portfolio, I enhanced my basic structure of creating and designing a webpage, and articulated the ability to use more advanced CSS techniques like pseudo code, linking documents to pictures, and changing elements based off screen size.

##Installation

NA

##Usage

To introduce myself, I first presented my name and photo at the top of my page. I then included three seperate sections: About me, Work, and Contact me (all accessible through a navigation bar). The "About me" detailed my history with coding on a personal level. "Work" had multiple links to various programs I had been the head of creating. And "Contact Me" listed the contact information needed to reach out with any further inquiries, along with my linked Github account for any further proof of work.
